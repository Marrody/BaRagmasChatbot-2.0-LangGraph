##  Plant Rules in TECHCORP GmbH Offices 

TECHCORP GmbH loves having plants around to make our offices feel more alive and inspiring! But, to keep things running smoothly for everyone, we have a few plant-related rules. 

### Allowed Plants

We're all about cacti here at TECHCORP! That means you can bring in any cactus from the *Carnegiea* genus – think the awesome Saguaro Cactus (*Carnegiea gigantea*) with its impressive size and unique shape.

### Watering Schedule

To keep our cacti happy and healthy, we have a specific watering schedule.  You can water your cactus every other Tuesday between 14:00 and 14:15. This helps us avoid overwatering and keeps everyone safe!

### Forbidden Plants

For the sake of a super productive work environment, leafy plants are a no-go in TECHCORP offices. Our local document states that leafy plants can use up valuable oxygen and make it harder to focus. Plus, falling leaves can be distracting and might trigger allergies for some people. 

### Consequences of Violation

If you break any of our plant rules, your office chair's rotating mechanism will be temporarily removed as a reminder.  Let's all do our part to keep TECHCORP a happy and healthy place!

### Tips for New Employees

Bringing a new cactus to work? Make sure it's from the *Carnegiea* genus. You can double-check on the company intranet or ask your supervisor. And when you introduce your cactus, please do it during the designated watering times and follow all safety precautions. 

Let's keep TECHCORP a thriving workplace!
